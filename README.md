# seismology

This reposity includes two MATLAB scripts.

RCS_Total produces a plot of the data that has been through a FIR lowpass
filter, and a spectrogram of the raw data.

MultiWFCorr produces four figures, all of which are included in this
repository (listed below) in two formats. The .tif files are too large
to view in GitHub so I converted them to PDF format. .tif files can be
downloaded for larger viewing.

Data: the full raw, unfiltered data

Master: the filtered master event against which all sections are correlated

Coeffs: all the correlation coefficients from correlation with the master event

SpecCoeffs: spectrogram of Coeffs

This repository also includes the final deliverable for the Experiential Learning
credit required by my undergraduate degree at Quest University Canada. This analysis
explores the spectral content and timing variation of the seismic pulses observed
on Mt Rainier in November 2014. This document is merely a snapshot of my knowledge on
seismology and signal processing 3 weeks after beginning my self-guided study of the subject.
