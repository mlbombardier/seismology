# seismology

This reposity includes two MATLAB scripts.

RCS_Total produces a plot of the data that has been through a FIR lowpass
filter, and a spectrogram of the raw data.

MultiWFCorr produces four figures, all of which are included in this
repository (listed below) in two formats. The .tif files are too large
to view in GitHub so I converted them to PDF format. .tif files can be
downloaded for larger viewing.

Data: the full raw, unfiltered data

Master: the filtered master event against which all sections are correlated

Coeffs: all the correlation coefficients from correlation with the master event

SpecCoeffs: spectrogram of Coeffs
