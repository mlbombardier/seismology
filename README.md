# seismology

This repository includes a MATLAB script and the four figures that are produced from it
in two formats. The .tif files are too large to view in GitHub so I converted them
to PDF format. .tif files can be downloaded for larger viewing.

Data: the full raw, unfiltered data

Master: the filtered master event against which all sections are correlated

Coeffs: all the correlation coefficients

SpecCoeffs: spectrogram of Coeffs
